Twilio will send our app the request

Our app will ask cartodb where that bus stop lives?
http://localfreeweb.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT stop_lat, stop_lon FROM stops WHERE stop_id = 660

CartoDb will return the lat, lon

Our flask app will use that lat, lon to ask CartoDB the give us the three closest to that lat lon
http://localfreeweb.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT name, ST_Distance(the_geom::geography, ST_PointFromText('POINT(-122.475096 37.72119)', 4326)::geography) AS distance FROM freeweb ORDER BY distance ASC LIMIT 3

Our flask app will then tell Twilio to text the data back to that person.
